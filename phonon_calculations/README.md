In this directory are inputs to do phonon calculations for both densities using [ALAMODE](https://github.com/ttadano/alamode). For each density there are two inputs: `force_constants.in` which calculates force constants from the provided forces and displacements, and `band_structure.in` which uses these force constants to calculate a band structure. The forces and displacements are contained in `DFSET` and `DFSET_with_frozen_phonons`. These forces were calculated with RQMC using the inputs provided in `../force_calculations`. The difference between the two DFSET files is that the latter contains 5 more sets of forces which come from frozen phonon calculations.
